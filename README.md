# NB Craft Java Plugin (1.21.3)

This is a simple plugin I created to test ideas, features, and new frameworks. It is built on Paper for Minecraft Java Edition (Paper) 1.21.3. (This is the tested version and the version the plugin was built for. Other versions of the game can work but may experience issues.)

## Commands:
- /itemdata 
- /itemdamage ((set <damage>) | get)
